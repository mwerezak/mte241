Init Task (init):
Initializes a memory pool and then allocates nearly all of the pool to itself.
Then creates all of the other tasks. The task5 (lhp) is created after some delay.

After creating the tasks, the init task sleeps for another delay and then frees
all of it's memory.

Task2 (status)
This task periodically prints the status of all the tasks.

Task3 (ehp)
This task is one of the first to be created by init and has a high priority. It
attempts to allocate most of the memory pool to itself, waits a short period of time,
and then frees all of it's allocated memory.

Task4 (elp)
This task is one of the first to be created by init and has a low priority. It
attempts to allocate most of the memory pool to itself, waits a short period of time,
and then frees all of it's allocated memory.

Task5 (lhp)
This task is the last to be created by init and has a high priority. It
attempts to allocate most of the memory pool to itself, waits a short period of time,
and then frees all of it's allocated memory.


We expect that all the tasks should become blocked waiting for memory until init frees 
it's memory. Then the tasks should run in the order of Task3, Task5 and then Task4.
