Q1. The RTX_Config.h has a list of variables externally defined in RTX_lib.c file, which
is located at ARM\RV31\INC under the default Keil installation directory. What does
os_active_TCB array contain?

The os_active_TCB array is an array of active task pointers. These pointers reference an OS_TCB data structure defined in rt_TypeDef.h.

Q2. Is the os_idle_daemon an element in the os_active_TCB?

Executing the following code snippet:

	for (i = 0; i < os_maxtaskrun; i++) {
		printf("os_active_TCB[%d]: %d, is_os_idle_demon=%d\n", i, os_active_TCB[i], os_active_TCB[i] == &os_idle_demon);
	}

Produced the results:

	os_active_TCB[0]: 268435532, is_os_idle_demon=0
	os_active_TCB[1]: 268435580, is_os_idle_demon=0
	os_active_TCB[2]: 268435628, is_os_idle_demon=0
	os_active_TCB[3]: 0, is_os_idle_demon=0
	os_active_TCB[4]: 0, is_os_idle_demon=0
	os_active_TCB[5]: 0, is_os_idle_demon=0
	
which shows that os_idle_demon is not an element of os_active_TCB.

Q3. For a task with task ID n, what is the index of this taskâ€™s TCB in the array
os_active_TCB?

Task IDs appear to be defined using the OS_TID type, which is an unsigned integer. The index of the task's TCB is this integer value minus one. Therefore the index is n-1.
